**Can I use your documents as templates?**     
You are very welcome to use any language and content from this repo. My syllabus has been added in three type of formats to help people who would like to use it as templates. I originally used the Pages template to created but not all people have Apple devices so I converted it in Word and pdf for easier sharing.
You can watch or ‚≠ê star the repo to get notified automatically for any changes or new additions.      
Make sure to credit people at all times not just with these resources!

**I've spotted a mistake or would like to contribute**   
Please open a new issue. Better yet, please fork the repo and submit an upstream pull request. I'm very grateful for any contributions, but may be slow to respond (trying to get a doctorate done).

**Why are you doing this?**    
I am very excited for teaching my own classes and designing them. I strongly believe that we do not have to reinvent the wheel if not necessary so collective 

**What can you do to thank me?**     
This is a weird thing that someone asked me. I just would really appreciate it if you share it with your peers and also give credit where credit is due.
